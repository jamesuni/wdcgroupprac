** to run server 
npm run dev

The server is capable of running on a given port as provided in server.js. Once started, automatically restarts to accomodate new changes, due to nodemon module. Server cannot use templates yet, as require a template language.

The directory is already handled and should be capable of being ported to other computers. 'public' stores static files, 'routes' will contain js files used to direct server to parts of the webpage, 'views' will contain templates used for automatic generation of pages i.e journal entries.
